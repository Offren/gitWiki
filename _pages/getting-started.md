# Getting Started with Our Wiki

Welcome to our documentation! This page will help you understand how to use and contribute to the wiki.

## Adding New Articles

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `_pages` directory
2. Add YAML front matter at the top with layout and title
3. Write your content in Markdown format

## Editing Pages

All pages are stored as Markdown files in the `_pages` directory. Simply edit the `.md` files to update content.

## Markdown Tips

- Use `#` for headings
- Use `*` or `-` for bullet points
- Use `1.` for numbered lists
- Use `[text](url)` for links
