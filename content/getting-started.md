# Getting Started

This guide will help you understand how to use and contribute to the wiki.

## Adding New Pages

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content` directory
2. Add front matter with title and category
3. Write your content in Markdown
   - Optionally, you can add pictures by uploading your image file to `public\images` directory and then using the file path.
       ```markdown
       Images can be embedded with captions:

      ![Example diagram](/images/example-diagram.png)
      *Figure 1: An example diagram showing the documentation structure*
       ```
   - See [Example Article](/content/example-article) for all formatting tips
5. Commit and push to your wiki's GitHub repository

## Organizing Content

- Use folders to organize related content
- Add front matter to set page metadata
- Link between pages using relative paths
